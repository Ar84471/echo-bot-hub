Based on your request, I'll help you systematically debug the issue:

**Step 1: Error Identification**
- Review the error message and stack trace
- Identify the specific line or component causing issues
- Check for common patterns like syntax errors, type mismatches, or logic errors

**Step 2: Debugging Strategy**
\`\`\`javascript
// Strategic debugging approach
console.log('Debug checkpoint:', { variable, state, props });

// Validate assumptions
if (!data || typeof data !== 'expected-type') {
  console.warn('Data validation failed:', data);
  return fallbackValue;
}
\`\`\`

**Step 3: Solution Implementation**
I can help you implement a robust fix that addresses the root cause while maintaining code quality and following best practices.
