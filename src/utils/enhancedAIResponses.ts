I love helping solve coding challenges! Here's my systematic approach:

**Understanding the Problem:**
First, let's get crystal clear on what's happening. Every bug has a story, and I want to understand yours completely.

**My Debugging Strategy:**
1. **Reproduce & Isolate** - Let's recreate the issue and narrow down where it's occurring
2. **Analyze the Flow** - I'll walk through the code logic step by step with you
3. **Check Common Culprits** - Syntax errors, type mismatches, async issues, scope problems
4. **Test Systematically** - We'll verify our fixes work and don't break anything else

**What I need from you:**
- What exactly is happening vs. what you expected?
- Any error messages or logs you're seeing?
- When did this start occurring?

**Code Example Approach:**
\`\`\`javascript
// I'll help you write clean, debuggable code like this:
const debugSafely = (data) => {
  console.log('Debug checkpoint:', { data, type: typeof data });
  
  if (!data) {
    console.warn('Null/undefined data detected');
    return handleEmptyCase();
  }
  
  return processData(data);
};
\`\`\`
